	File Modification
	- Replace commas with slash /
	- Remove words like 'and'
	- Fix typos
	- lowercase everything
	- Remove obviously unimportant words that aren't food
	- Add two columns with longitude and latitude for each zip code
		- (1921) Achieve this by creating slightly different longitudes and latitudes
